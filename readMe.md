# Game Tutorials Features Overview

This document provides an overview of the key features and challenges incorporated within the games. It is more of a reminder for myself to remember what's in each project.

## Player Control

-   **Car on Bridge**: Players control a car traversing a bridge, with the game camera following the action in a third-person perspective. This mode emphasizes navigation and control skills as players maneuver through the environment.
    
-   **Challenge 1: Airplane Obstacle Course**: Inspired by the mechanics of Flappy Bird, players pilot an airplane through a series of obstacles. Success requires precise control and timing to avoid collisions.
    

## Basic Gameplay

-   **Animal Feeder**: In this engaging activity, players shoot food at various animals. The goal is to feed all the animals with food, challenging the player's aim and timing.
    
-   **Challenge 2: Play Fetch**: In this interactive challenge, a ball will spawn in random locations, and players must time the spawn of the dog correctly to ensure it catches the ball. This tests the player's anticipation and timing skills, as they must predict the best moment to release the dog for a successful fetch, taking into account the unpredictability of the ball's spawning point.
    

## Sound and Effects

Gameplay involves collecting power-ups and engaging in zumo-style combat with NPCs. The difficulty and number of enemies increase with each round, challenging the player's strategy and agility.

-   **Challenge 4: Soccer**: Stop soccer balls from reaching the goal.

## User Interface
